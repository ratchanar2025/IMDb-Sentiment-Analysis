# 🎬 IMDb Sentiment Classification

## 📌 Project Overview 
The goal is to build a simple machine learning model that can classify movie reviews as **positive** or **negative** based on a IMDb movie review dataset.

The dataset consists of two columns:
- `review` → the text of the movie review  
- `sentiment` → the label (`positive` / `negative`)

## ⚙️ Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Converted all text to lowercase  
- Removed punctuation, special characters, and numbers  
- Removed stopwords (common words like *the, is, and*)  
- Tokenized text into words  
- Applied lemmatization (reducing words to root form, e.g., *movies → movie*)  

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Used **TF-IDF Vectorization** to transform text into numerical features.  
- Compared with **CountVectorizer**, but TF-IDF gave better results.  

### 3. Model Training
- Trained two models:
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Naive Bayes**  
- Data split: 80% training, 20% testing  

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluation metrics:
  - **Accuracy Score**  
  - **Confusion Matrix**  
  - **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## 📊 Results
| Model               | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | ~86.96%     |
| Naive Bayes          | ~85.17%     |

## 🖼️ Visualizations
- **WordClouds** → most frequent words in positive and negative reviews  
- **Confusion Matrix** → to understand misclassifications
